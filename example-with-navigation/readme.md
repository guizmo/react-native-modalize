# Modalize alon side react-navigation


Packages used:
- react-navigation
- mobx & mobx-react
- react-native-modalize

I have put Modalize inside another component at the root of the application (outside the rooter).
I use a store to trigger the events (close, open) and set the modal (props, ref) and set the visibility of the modal
